## Introduction

This project implements a CNN for recognizing hand gestures from images. The model is designed to classify images into two categories: gesture present (1) or no gesture (0). This can be applied in various domains such as accessibility tools, virtual reality, and gaming.

## Model Architecture

The model consists of the following layers:

1. **Base Model**: A pre-trained model (like MobileNet) to extract features from input images.
2. **Convolutional Layers**: Additional layers to further refine feature extraction:
   - **Conv2D Layer**: Applies a convolution operation with ReLU activation.
   - **MaxPooling2D Layer**: Reduces spatial dimensions, retaining important features.
3. **Flatten Layer**: Flattens the 3D output to 1D for the fully connected layers.
4. **Dense Layers**:
   - A fully connected layer with ReLU activation.
   - A dropout layer for regularization.
   - An output layer with sigmoid activation to classify the gesture.


## Requirements

### Software
- Python 3.x
- Libraries:
  - TensorFlow or Keras
  - NumPy
  - OpenCV (for image handling)
  - Matplotlib (for visualization)

### Hardware
- A computer with a capable GPU (recommended for training deep learning models)
- Sufficient storage for datasets and models

## Data Collection

### Gesture Dataset
- Collect images representing different hand gestures. Ensure diversity in lighting and backgrounds.
- Organize images into directories for each gesture class (e.g., "gesture" and "no_gesture").

### Preprocessing
- Resize images to a consistent size (e.g., 224x224 pixels).
- Normalize pixel values to [0, 1].
- Optionally, apply data augmentation techniques (e.g., rotations, flips).

## Training the Model

1. **Compile the Model**:
   - Use binary cross-entropy as the loss function.
   - Use the Adam optimizer for training.

2. **Fit the Model**:
   - Split the dataset into training and validation sets.
   - Train the model on the training set while validating on the validation set.


## Implementation

1. **Setup**:
   - Clone the repository and install the required libraries.
   - Prepare the dataset as described in the Data Collection section.

2. **Model Evaluation**:
   - Use a test set to evaluate the model's performance after training.

## Usage

1. Load the trained model.
2. Capture images using a webcam or upload images for classification.
3. Preprocess the images before feeding them into the model for prediction.

## Evaluation Metrics

To assess model performance, use the following metrics:
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1 Score
- Confusion Matrix

## Future Work

- Expand the dataset to include more gesture classes.
- Optimize the model for faster inference on mobile devices.
- Implement multi-gesture recognition and tracking.
- Explore applications in virtual and augmented reality environments.
