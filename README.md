# Image Classification 

This project performs binary image classification using a convolutional neural network (CNN) model that builds on the VGG16 architecture as a feature extractor. The VGG16 layers are frozen to retain pre-trained weights, and additional layers are added to fine-tune the model for the dataset.

## Project Overview

The objective of this project is to classify images into two distinct categories. Using the VGG16 model pre-trained on ImageNet as a feature extractor, this model effectively adapts to a binary classification task by adding custom layers after the base model.

## Installation

Install the required libraries, including TensorFlow and Keras. A GPU is recommended if available, as training on large datasets will be more efficient.

## Dataset

The dataset should be organized with separate folders for each class within training, validation, and test directories. This format supports a structured approach for training and evaluation, with distinct categories represented by subfolders.

### Folder Structure
The dataset folder should look like this:

```plaintext
dataset/
├── train/
│   ├── class_1/
│   └── class_2/
├── validation/
│   ├── class_1/
│   └── class_2/
└── test/
    ├── class_1/
    └── class_2/
```

Replace `class_1` and `class_2` with your actual class names.

## Model Architecture

1. **Base Model (VGG16)**: This uses the pre-trained VGG16 model on ImageNet without the top (fully connected) layers. The layers are frozen to preserve the pre-trained weights.
2. **Additional Layers**:
   - Three additional Conv2D layers with increasing filters, followed by max-pooling layers, to learn more specific features from the dataset.
   - Flattening layer followed by dense layers, including a dropout layer for regularization.
   - A single neuron in the output layer with a sigmoid activation for binary classification.

## Training the Model

Compile the model with binary cross-entropy as the loss function and the Adam optimizer. The model is trained using the training dataset, with the validation dataset used for tuning and monitoring overfitting.

### Key Hyperparameters:
- **Epochs**: Generally between 20-50, depending on dataset size and model convergence.
- **Batch Size**: Common values are 32, 64, or 128.

## Evaluation

The model’s performance is evaluated on a separate test set. Metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score can provide insights into the model's generalization ability.

## Usage

The trained model can be used to classify new images. Input images need to be preprocessed to match the model’s expected input size.

## Results

Once the model is trained and evaluated, the results section should summarize:
- Accuracy metrics from training, validation, and test sets.
- Visualizations of training and validation loss and accuracy over epochs.
- Confusion matrix and classification report to highlight performance on each class.
